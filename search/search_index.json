Easily add recipes into your database by providing the url and mealie will automatically import the relevant data or add a family recipe with the UI editor. Mealie also provides an API for interactions from 3rd party applications. Why does my recipe manager need an API? An API allows integration into applications like Home Assistant that can act as notification engines to provide custom notifications based of Meal Plan data to remind you to defrost the chicken, marinade the steak, or start the CrockPot. Additionally, you can access any available API from the backend server. To explore the API spin up your server and navigate to http://yourserver.com/docs for interactive API documentation. Note In some of the demo gifs the styling may be different than the finale application. demos were done during development prior to finale styling. Warning Note that this is a ALPHA release and that means things may break and or change down the line. I'll do my best to make sure that any API changes are thoughtful and necessary in order not to break things. Additionally, I'll do my best to provide a migration path if the database schema ever changes. That said, one of the nice things about MongoDB is that it's flexible!

Currently this scraper is implemented with scrape-schema-recipe package . You may have mixed results on some websites, especially with blogs or non specific recipe websites. See the bulk import Option below for another a convenient way to add blog style recipes into Mealie. Recipe Editor Recipes can be edited and created via the UI. This is done with both a form based approach where you have a UI to work with as well as with a in browser JSON Editor. The JSON editor allows you to easily copy and paste data from other sources. You can also add a custom recipe with the UI editor built into the web view. After logging in as a user you'll have access to the editor to make changes to all the content in the recipe. Bulk Import Mealie also supports bulk import of recipe instructions and ingredients. Select \"Bulk Add\" in the editor and paste in your plain text data to be parsed. Each line is treated as one entry and will be appended to the existing ingredients or instructions if they exist. Empty lines will be stripped from the text. Schema Recipes are stored in the json-like format in mongoDB and then sent and edited in json format on the frontend. Each recipes uses Recipe Schema as a general guide with some additional properties specific to Mealie.
